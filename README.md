# public dotfiles

this is a copy of my real configs, with references to nix store paths removed

these are likely not going to be maintained very often because my real configs are in my nix flake

## stuff needed

- waybar
- mako
- blueman (for `blueman-manager`)
- pavucontrol
- kitty ($mod+Q)
- grimblast (PrtSc, Ctrl+PrtSc)
